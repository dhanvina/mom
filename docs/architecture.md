# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The MOM (Multi-Output Manager) system follows a modular architecture designed for extensibility and maintainability.

## Data Flow

1. **Input Layer**: Data enters through the main input interface
2. **Processing Layer**: Core logic processes and transforms data
3. **Output Layer**: Results are distributed to multiple output channels

### Data Pipeline

```
Input → Validation → Processing → Transformation → Output
```

## Core Components

### 1. Input Handler
- Accepts and validates incoming data
- Supports multiple input formats
- Performs initial data sanitization

### 2. Processing Engine
- Central processing logic
- Handles data transformation
- Manages business rules

### 3. Output Manager
- Coordinates multiple output channels
- Ensures data consistency
- Handles error recovery

## Extensibility

The architecture supports extensibility through:

- **Plugin System**: Add new functionality without modifying core code
- **Middleware Hooks**: Intercept and modify data at various stages
- **Custom Output Handlers**: Create new output channels easily
- **Configuration-Driven**: Behavior can be modified through configuration files

## Technology Stack

- Core implementation language and frameworks
- Database and storage solutions
- External dependencies

## Security Considerations

- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- Audit logging

## Performance

- Asynchronous processing where applicable
- Caching strategies
- Scalability considerations
