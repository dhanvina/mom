# Security Policy

## Responsible Disclosure

We take the security of this project seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and users who help us maintain a secure codebase. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, we encourage responsible disclosure and will work with you to address the issue promptly.

### Our Commitment

- We will respond to your report within 48 hours with our evaluation and expected timeline for a fix
- We will keep you informed about our progress toward resolving the issue
- We will credit you for your discovery in our release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will not take legal action against researchers who follow responsible disclosure practices

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### How to Report Securely

**Option 1: GitHub Security Advisories (Recommended)**
1. Navigate to the "Security" tab of this repository
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill out the advisory details form with as much information as possible

**Option 2: Email**
- Send your report to: [security@example.com]
- Use PGP encryption if possible (key available at: [link to PGP key])
- Include "SECURITY" in the subject line

### What to Include in Your Report

To help us better understand and resolve the issue, please include:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass)
- **Full paths of affected source files**
- **Location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue**
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if applicable)
- **Impact assessment** - what an attacker could achieve
- **Suggested remediation** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

Please ensure you're using a supported version before reporting issues.

## Security Best Practices

For contributors and users of this project, here's a quick checklist for maintaining code security:

### Code Security Checklist

#### Input Validation & Sanitization
- [ ] Validate all user inputs against expected formats
- [ ] Sanitize data before processing or display
- [ ] Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- [ ] Implement proper input length restrictions
- [ ] Validate file uploads (type, size, content)

#### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Use strong, industry-standard authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Implement proper session management
- [ ] Enforce principle of least privilege
- [ ] Use secure password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2)
- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication where appropriate
- [ ] Set appropriate session timeouts

#### Data Protection
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- [ ] Use HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- [ ] Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to version control
- [ ] Use environment variables or secure vaults for sensitive configuration
- [ ] Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

#### Dependency Management
- [ ] Keep all dependencies up to date
- [ ] Regularly run security audits (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, etc.)
- [ ] Review dependency licenses and security advisories
- [ ] Minimize the number of dependencies
- [ ] Use dependency pinning and lock files

#### Code Quality
- [ ] Follow secure coding guidelines for your language/framework
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Conduct code reviews with security in mind
- [ ] Use static analysis security testing (SAST) tools
- [ ] Implement automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline

#### API Security
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and throttling
- [ ] Use API authentication and authorization
- [ ] Validate and sanitize API inputs
- [ ] Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] Implement CORS policies correctly

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
- [ ] Escape output based on context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URL)
- [ ] Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- [ ] Avoid using `eval()` and similar dangerous functions
- [ ] Sanitize user-generated content

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention
- [ ] Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- [ ] Use SameSite cookie attribute
- [ ] Verify Origin and Referer headers

#### General Security Practices
- [ ] Keep software and systems patched and updated
- [ ] Implement proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Use security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- [ ] Perform regular security assessments and penetration testing
- [ ] Have an incident response plan
- [ ] Document security architecture and threat models
